Your feedback helped to prioritize specific recommendations for testing and will continue to inform the process as we move into the feasibility phase.", "In the coming weeks, we will announce the formation of feasibility study working groups and their respective charges. While we will invite our academic and administrative leaders to nominate members for these groups, we encourage anyone from the faculty and professional staff to nominate themselves to serve. More details will be shared soon.", "Based on the UAC\u2019s report, I want to summarize how we will move forward with each of the recommendations.", "I will address the ", "recommendation first. The feasibility of transitioning to a semester-based system will be thoroughly tested. Final decisions will be based on an analysis of all relevant data and a determination of which academic schedule best supports our students and faculty. In particular, I am determined to enhance Drexel\u2019s competitive advantage in experiential learning by strengthening our Co-op program and maintaining our excellent relationships with major Co-op employers. We therefore need to fully understand how organizing our academic calendar by semesters would affect our Co-op program \u2013 and how our employers would experience this transition. Including these employers as active participants in the feasibility study will help us make the right decision.", "Second, ", ". I strongly agree with the UAC that every undergraduate we enroll should have a shared Drexel experience and acquire differentiating skills that highlight the unique qualities of a Drexel education. Greater curricular alignment can also support enhanced flexibility for students to move across programs. Feasibility testing will be focused on the viability, timeline and resources needed to establish core competencies and the strategy for defining the competencies themselves.", "Third, ", ". I agree with the UAC that it should be easier for students to navigate Drexel, to find programs that are right for them, and to experience more of what a comprehensive teaching and research university offers. We all understand that more opportunities to collaborate across our respective units translates into innovation, greater capacity for external partnerships, and successful research activity. In many cases the current configuration of our schools, colleges, and programs significantly hinders our ability to achieve these objectives.", "The change proposed by the UAC to organize all our colleges and schools into five academic clusters is at an order of magnitude beyond the University\u2019s capacity at this time, and would entail significant uncertainty and risk. A more measured approach therefore should be taken. As a result I propose a pilot to build an academic grouping among the College of Arts and Sciences, the Richard C. Goodwin College of Professional Studies, and the School of Education, and hope to develop an effective \u201cplaybook\u201d based on the pilot that we can learn from and apply to future opportunities. For now, this will be the only academic cluster that we will undertake.", "Fourth, ", "of policies and practices. I agree with the UAC that enhanced consistency across Drexel policies and practices holds great potential for improving both the student, faculty and professional staff experience and the overall efficiency of the University. But I would go a step further: No other UAC recommendation bears more directly on Drexel\u2019s future than putting an end to the bureaucratic policies, processes, and business practices that thwart collaboration, waste precious time, energy, and money, and hold our University back. Whether the issues involve teaching loads, course credit requirements, grant proposal development, contract management, budgeting for interdisciplinary programming, or procurement, we need to make work at Drexel less frustrating and opaque, and more accessible, productive, and successful for everyone. As is the case with all the other recommendations, a feasibility study team will develop an actionable plan for making not just consistency, but also coherence, cohesion, and collaboration the order of the day at Drexel.", "And finally, ", ". The UAC\u2019s report calls for physical spaces that enrich the student experience, foster programmatic coordination and integration, and encourage collaboration across the University so everyone can do their best work. Happily, this recommendation is confluent with the work we have been doing over the past decade guided by our Campus Master Plan to produce a more vibrant live-work-play environment at Drexel. Led by Vice President for Real Estate & Facilities Alan Greenberger, this effort will move forward under an updated campus master plan that will align with the UAC\u2019s vision for community spaces. That vision is reflected in these exciting projects:", "Going forward, I will continue to keep the community updated and informed as these feasibility studies proceed. Provost Jensen will follow up with more detail in the coming weeks after we finalize the charges and teams that will guide this work.", "I want to reassure all of you that the decisions regarding the UAC recommendations will be based on rigorous analysis and the best available evidence of what serves the needs and interests of our students; what advances our goals and affirms our Shared Values under our ", "; and what promotes the greater good of the University.", "I want to thank the Provost Jensen, Faculty Senate Chair Owens, the members of the UAC, and everyone who has offered their time and insights. It is heartening to see our community join together in dialogue and problem solving, and I especially appreciate the willingness and desire to put the needs and interests of our students first.

This is an exciting time at the University, with many improvements on the horizon. But as we enter the third year of a five-year transition, it has become clear that \u2014 with the expected smaller freshman classes \u2014\u00a0our vision to create a stronger Drexel requires renewed patience, greater flexibility and short-term sacrifice.", "Fortunately, we are embarking on this new strategy from a position of strength. Drexel is financially sound, with \u201cA\u201d ratings and \u201cStable\u201d outlooks from both Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s ratings agencies. But nationwide, universities are preparing for an era of greater price sensitivity and declining enrollment, and in a region crowded with higher-ed options, our goal is to remain competitive and position Drexel well for the next decade and beyond.", "As we have discussed previously, our new enrollment strategy replaces a high \u201cvolume-based\u201d approach with a more selective stance that admits students with the academic and financial ability to succeed at Drexel. Likewise, we will continue to minimize tuition increases and increase financial aid to better positon Drexel for the future. For the next five years, the University expects to hold total increases in charges (tuition, room, board and fees) to under 2 percent.", "This transition will improve our academic quality and, eventually, our retention and graduation rates. Our performance in recent university ratings that emphasize student success already is strong, and our enrollment strategy should only enhance our standing. ", "But it will take time. We need to continue to reshape the University to reflect decreases in revenues that result from smaller incoming classes, larger graduating classes, minimal tuition and fee increases, and greater investment in student financial aid.\u00a0 ", "This transition will require difficult decisions. But it\u2019s the right thing to do for Drexel\u2019s future.", "The following are key elements of our strategy, and the state of the University for 2017 and the years immediately ahead.", "Over the years, Drexel\u2019s admissions policies had become too easy, resulting in a glut of applications. But many of the applicants knew little about the University and were not always serious about attending. This forced us to dedicate significant enrollment resources admitting students who ultimately enrolled in other schools. In addition, our historical practices for awarding financial aid focused too much on recruiting a freshman class and less on providing the kind of support that would allow students to succeed through graduation. As such, our retention and yield rates suffered. ", "So, we changed course. Our focus became recruiting and enrolling future alumni, not just freshmen, with improving retention and graduation outcomes among our highest priorities. We\u2019re doing that in many ways.", "We\u2019ve crafted an application process designed to be more thoughtful, and we imposed a reasonable fee to ensure qualified applicants were seriously interested in a Drexel education. We are working more closely than ever with guidance counselors to get out the word about Drexel\u2019s unique story \u2014 its focus on experiential learning, as well as our graduates\u2019 career success. We\u2019re also beating a path to the doorsteps of thousands more prospective students: with 1,375 high school visits, college fairs, off-campus receptions and counselor receptions for the fall 2017 recruitment cycle, up from 75 in 2014.", "Enrolling right-fit students is only the beginning. Supporting those students is critical, and our retention efforts are comprehensive. We are carefully evaluating our support of students academically, financially, socially, and in terms of their professional development. The University is revising academic policies and practices to free advisors from administrative work in order to spend more time as advisors, coaches and mentors, and also implemented a sophisticated early warning system to identify at-risk students, so an advisor can intervene.", "The results are showing. It was our expectation that these changes would result in a concomitant increase in yield. The yield rate for the fall 2015 freshman class was 12.7 percent, up 4 percent over the fall 2014 freshman class. We lost ground for the fall 2016 freshman class, due in part to moves by our two strongest competitors, and this contributed to the challenges we were already anticipating as a result of our new recruitment and enrollment strategy. Nevertheless, our yield rate last fall was 10.9 percent \u2014 still a significant gain over the 8.7 percent yield in fall 2014. ", "On retention, we have experienced significant success with an 89.1 percent first-year retention rate for the fall 2015 freshman class. This represents a more than 5 percent increase over the fall 2014 class, and a 4.3 percent increase over the average one-year retention rate for the last five freshman cohorts. ", "These outcomes in retention exceed even the most optimistic expectations of the division of Enrollment Management and Student Success. But the benefits of a shift to a model focused on right-fit students will not be realized right away. Our commitment is to stay the course as we navigate our way to better retention and graduation rates and provide the best experience we can for our students. This strategy will continue to enhance our reputation for excellence regionally, nationally, and globally.", "Being a largely tuition-driven institution, changes in enrollments and tuition revenues directly impact Drexel. As a result, over the past three fiscal years, senior leaders across the University have worked to identify ways to increase revenues besides tuition, and to reduce expenditures and increase efficiency without compromising our core investments in academic quality. Difficult decisions were made, including the reorganization of some administrative units. These were required to ensure we were providing the best services to our students, support for our faculty and professional staff, and sound financial management. ", "Nearly $100 million in budget reductions, largely from administrative units, along with reallocating resources to strengthen academic programs and financial aid, have been made during fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017. ", "Based on conservative long-range budget projections, University revenues are expected to decline in FY18 and FY19 as larger classes enrolled at a lower discount rate graduate, and we significantly minimize tuition, room and board increases. Then, in FY20, the University once again will be positioned for revenue growth.", "For the next two fiscal years, we will determine what expense reduction efforts we must implement on a permanent basis to balance the budget. Opportunities being evaluated include: renegotiating contracts, delaying new investment funds, reviewing benefits and merit awards, and evaluating academic programs and administrative processes.", "On the revenue side, we need to determine if we can grow undergraduate enrollment without impacting quality, while reviewing our discount rate, growing graduate and online enrollments, increasing our fundraising to grow the endowment and to support current operational initiatives, and increasing research and grant funding.", "The University has approximately 3 percent more students now than in 2010, yet it has 19.7 percent more faculty and 6.6 percent more professional staff. Of course, the majority of the growth in the faculty has been driven by adding research-active faculty in the service of enhancing our research mission. In addition, we have in some cases strategically replaced adjunct faculty with full-time teaching faculty in order to better serve our students. I therefore appreciate that the growth in the faculty does not translate directly into a corresponding growth in teaching resources. Nevertheless, just as administrative streamlining has been vigorously pursued, the academic enterprise also must be closely examined by the provost, deans and faculties to meet the reduced revenue expectations that come with smaller incoming classes. ", "Over the past five years, the University added 100 tenure-track faculty in key academic areas, which I consider a signature achievement. This commitment required a $2.7 million budget increase each year, plus an additional $1 million in startup costs. With declining revenues, last year we scaled back this initiative and focused on recruiting faculty who filled key positions or satisfied contractual requirements. We will channel our future academic investments to recruit strategically in areas such as those identified by our Market-Driven Academic Program Ventures, and to promote academic program growth and enrollments, where student demand is strong. ", "We also will continue Program Assessment Reviews to match academic offerings with market demand and student interest. Over the next two years, the provost and the deans, in consultation with the faculties and Faculty Senate, will review appropriate and effective teaching workload with tenured, tenure-track, and teaching faculty; remove or combine small class sections; reallocate and streamline instructional duties for teaching faculty and adjunct faculty to meet curriculum and enrollment needs; and carefully examine programs that are no longer viable. In addition, we will examine where there may be areas of unnecessary duplication among professional staff duties within, and between, schools and colleges, and, where feasible, combine or eliminate positions.", "Research represents the second-largest source of revenue after tuition, and it will continue to be a cornerstone of our academic enterprise. The creation of new knowledge by faculty and students informs the mission of the University and enhances our standing among our peers. Between FY15 and FY16, research expenditures grew by 2 percent, while new research awards rose by 6 percent. However, the funding outlook for federal research grants, which support 80 percent of Drexel\u2019s research, is uncertain. And, with an unprecedented 11-year decline in federal R&D funding, it is unclear which investments Congress will prioritize moving forward. This, along with regulatory changes that have resulted in significant increases to the competition for funding, negatively affects most research-intensive universities.\u00a0\u00a0 ", "Within this research environment, we have four strategic goals to increase the quality and quantity of research at Drexel. The goals are to: increase individual faculty research productivity with support for improved grantsmanship and proposal development; increase high-value funding and reputational awards that stimulate large, interdisciplinary efforts with peer institutions, leveraging strategic initiatives such as the Drexel\u00a0Areas of Research Excellence program; build upon Drexel\u2019s strength with the Department of Defense and expand beyond collaborations with the U.S. Army to include the Air Force and Navy; and increase funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ", "Drexel\u2019s engagement with its neighborhoods and its role as an anchor institution in Philadelphia is central to the mission envisioned by our founder Anthony J. Drexel. What\u2019s more, we are very fortunate to have enlisted partners who largely offset the cost of strategic initiatives that, in many cases, have the potential to substantially expand University resources. Indeed, the University has already been the beneficiary of a number of gifts and grants directly tied to these efforts. The Drexel University community confidently can view these initiatives as sound, long-term investments that do not diminish our ability to support the core academic enterprise.", "Our work through the Dornsife Center for Neighborhood Partnerships and the Lindy Center for Civic Engagement \u2014 both initially made possible through donor support \u2014 is foundational and key to our academic enterprise. The two-fold aim of these efforts is to equip Drexel students, faculty, professional staff and alumni to be civically engaged citizens, and to empower our neighbors in the community to build productive lives. The Philadelphia School District\u2019s new Science Leadership Academy Middle School, currently housed at the Dornsife Center with plans to move into a public-private financed K-8 school at the former University City High School site, will enhance the School of Education\u2019s work in teaching tomorrow\u2019s classroom leaders. ", "Our drive to promote entrepreneurship and innovation in everything we do is backed by a constellation of important institutions and relationships. Drexel Ventures amplifies the University\u2019s capacity for translational research and commercialization through seamless integration of technology transfer, venture development services, industry collaboration, incubation space and capital. Drexel Ventures works closely with the Coulter-Drexel Translational Research Partnership Program, the Close School of Entrepreneurship and the Baiada Institute for Entrepreneurship \u2014 all donor-backed, and with enormous downstream potential to bring to market discoveries by faculty, students, alumni and regional entrepreneurs. ", "Similarly, our approach to creating an innovation district at Schuylkill Yards \u2014 and in support of the larger 30th Street Station District Plan \u2014 will be built with private investment through our development partner Brandywine Realty Trust. And by retaining ownership of the Schuylkill Yards footprint, Drexel stands to collect upwards of $200 million in ground-lease revenue that will be invested in the endowment. Meanwhile, the creation of mixed-use real estate and economic development on and around the campus will bring robust education and research initiatives, benefiting our co-op students, as well as faculty research. ", "Just as we set out in our Strategic Plan, our objective in all these efforts is to continue to transform Drexel into one of the most impactful and dynamic urban research universities in the country.", "Private philanthropy continues to be an essential and rapidly growing source of revenue for Drexel. Our last comprehensive campaign \u2014 \u201cDream It. Do It. Drexel.\u201d \u2014 concluded in December 2013 and exceeded its $400 million goal by $55 million. It established the foundation for a new era of fundraising at Drexel, broadening our base of support by 17,684 new donors and more than 2,300 additional qualified major gift prospects. ", "Since then, Drexel has enjoyed three consecutive years of record-setting fundraising. We\u2019ve raised nearly $300 million in new gifts and pledges, including the two largest single commitments in the University\u2019s history: the Thomas R. Kline School of Law \u2014 named by trial attorney Tom Kline in fall 2014 with a commitment of $50 million; and, the Dana and David \u00a0Dornsife School of Public Health \u2014 named by philanthropists Dana and David Dornsife, with a commitment of $45 million in the fall of 2015. In addition, our inaugural Day of Giving last fiscal year inspired 2,887 supporters to donate more than $713,514 in just 24 hours. ", "It is critical that we build on this momentum, leveraging the confidence that foundations and corporations have in Drexel as well as the pride of alumni, parents and friends. The University is now finalizing plans to publicly launch its most ambitious fundraising campaign later this year, with a goal of $750 million. The campaign will count all gifts and pledges since Dec. 1, 2013 \u2014 totaling approximately $305 million as of Dec. 31, 2016 \u2014 and is scheduled to conclude by Dec. 31, 2020.", "This initiative will target the needs of Drexel\u2019s faculty and students by focusing fundraising efforts on three broad categories. First, we will create new pathways for student success by establishing more endowed scholarships and fellowships; increasing paid co-op opportunities, particularly in the non-profit sector; and expanding academic advising and student support services. Second, we will pioneer approaches in teaching and learning by establishing endowed professorships to recruit and retain top faculty, sustaining our commitment to academically driven civic engagement through creative new faculty-led partnerships, creating additional technology-rich learning environments, and enhancing our standing as an online learning market leader. Third, we will accelerate multidisciplinary discovery and innovation by securing endowed funding for high-priority, interdisciplinary research areas; investing in key research centers and institutes; and upgrading critical research facilities and equipment, especially in the physical sciences and engineering. ", "The campaign will also focus on securing resources for additional strategic priorities such as public realm improvements to campus connectivity and appearance, and current-use funds at the school/college level. We also have non-financial goals, particularly increasing alumni engagement with the University through participation in giving, volunteering and event attendance. Our aggressive efforts to counter the national trend of declining alumni giving are showing promising results: Last fiscal year we reversed a five-year decline in alumni giving to Drexel, yielding a 9 percent increase in undergraduate alumni donors over the previous year. These efforts not only improve Drexel\u2019s standing in the rankings, but also help build a pipeline of potential donors that will support the University\u2019s ambitions in the decades to come. ", "The changes we are making now will not be easy, but are necessary to enhance Drexel\u2019s academic quality and continue to build our retention and graduation rates. Given an enrollment strategy that brings more students to Drexel who are prepared to succeed and take full advantage of everything this University has to offer, we expect our performance in collegiate rankings that emphasize student success to improve even further.\u00a0 ", "The adjustments we are making to the University\u2019s budget and spending will ensure Drexel\u2019s solid financial footing for the next decade and beyond. We will continue to grow in stature and influence as a private research university with a strong public purpose with our ongoing pursuit of translational research, and our emphasis on entrepreneurial education and experiential learning through the Drexel Co-op. And our strategic partnerships will improve the future for our neighbors and our city, while we leverage the resources of private development partners to create the setting for the new innovation economy. ", "At each stage in this process, we will do what\u2019s right and best for Drexel\u2019s future.

Each week, we see the impressive results: more than 3,200 courses and lab sessions being held remotely, core University functions fully operational while most employees work from home, and our faculty\u2019s powerful research directed toward protecting vulnerable populations from COVID-19 and helping alleviate suffering for those impacted by this disease. Of course, we are also grateful to the health care workers on our faculty and professional staff, who have been serving at the front lines of care for COVID-19 patients and other patients at this critical time. ", " Even so, this pandemic has taught us the hard lesson that no individual, no sector of the economy, and no organization will emerge unscathed. For higher education, quite broadly, and for Drexel, in particular, the financial impact of COVID-19 has been immediate and sweeping, and we expect it to be compounded by what could be a longer-term downturn in the global economy. We must work together to strengthen Drexel\u2019s financial capacity in the face of these daunting economic conditions.

Taking into account the impact of COVID-19 on this fiscal year (\u201919-\u201920) and next (\u201920-\u201921), the University needs to reduce its expenses by $90 million, which includes a 25 percent contingency factor.

We have already suspended the P-Card program, which has resulted in the reduction of nonessential spending by $5 million during the pandemic, as well as reduced our requisition activity by approximately $6 million. We will continue to look for savings of this kind. Other expense reductions in this category will include renegotiating contracts, reviewing leases, eliminating travel, and reducing spending on supplies, dues, memberships, printing and mailing.\u00a0All units will be asked to examine their operations and identify opportunities for savings and efficiencies.

In the second phase, beginning this month, we will develop revised budget plans for the University and every college, school and administrative unit. In the third phase, beginning this fall, we will assess and adjust as needed. The COVID-19 crisis has introduced many uncertainties over the coming months and years to an already uncertain higher education landscape. We will need to be prepared for further action, depending on how scenarios play out, in public health, in our sector, and in our University.", " Future", " At the same time as we implement immediate measures to secure Drexel\u2019s financial position, we will focus on a long-term strategy to strengthen the University\u2019s competitive position. A number of the steps being taken now are temporary solutions, while we continue to explore ways to reduce structural costs and operate more efficiently in the years to come.

We have worked together to find ways to adapt with incredible flexibility then and will do so again.", " When this pandemic hit, we pivoted in countless ways. Public Safety and Student Life saw to it that our students reached home safely. Faculty and professional staff quickly moved us toward becoming a hybrid university. The Office of Research and Innovation kept scientific inquiry thriving. The Steinbright\u00a0Career Development Center helped to ensure that 78 percent of students on co-ops this spring and summer are working remotely or will have a delayed start.

At the same time that we formed our Anti-Racism Task Force to evaluate and develop proposals in 11 areas of university life, we also commissioned a team of outside experts at ", ", who had worked with other leading universities to evaluate and improve their approaches to public safety, to conduct an in-depth review of the Drexel University Police Department (DUPD)\n", "\nNow that 21CP Solutions has completed its work, we are, as promised, sharing their full report with the University community while simultaneously announcing steps we will immediately begin taking to implement its key recommendations. The 98-page report is robust in detail, representing the culmination of many months of work and the critical contributions of approximately 550 individuals, including Drexel and West Philadelphia community members and stakeholders. We are grateful for the forthright engagement of so many of you who participated, and we believe the resulting report sets a new standard in depth, candor and transparency. We hope you will take the time to read and digest it all. But for today, in addition to highlighting its key findings, we want to announce that Marla Gold, MD, professor, dean emerita of the Dornsife School of Public Health, and recently named senior vice provost for Community Health and Chief Wellness Officer, will lead the implementation of the single largest recommendation by 21CP: that we at Drexel together engage in an inclusive, community-driven process of reimagining public safety \u2014 systematically defining what public safety is and how it might best be provided, both on our own campus and in our West Philadelphia neighborhoods.\n", "\nThe report itself, which you can find on the ", ",  reveals that Drexel is certainly not immune to the deeply divided experiences and perceptions that community members have about the police, often along racial lines. This racial divide, reflected by both long historical experience and so many recent high-profile cases of anti-Black violence, is unacceptable to us as a university community, as we know it is to the leadership and dedicated members of the DUPD. Our goal is to create a teaching and learning community that feels safe and truly welcoming to everyone. And by starting with this candid accounting of where we have fallen short and what we can do better, we are determined to reach that goal together.  \n", "\nFrom August 2020 through April 2021, 21CP conducted interviews and focus groups, collected additional feedback from the community provided via a dedicated email address and phone line, and gathered and analyzed data focused on key areas as outlined in an ", ".

The DUPD was established in its current form in the aftermath of the tragic mass shooting at Virginia Tech more than a dozen years ago, a moment of heightened national concern about campus security. Sadly, the years since have too often validated such safety concerns across our country. We are deeply grateful for the hard work and dedication of our DUPD officers, dispatchers and public safety personnel who have worked, especially this past year, to keep our campus community safe during an unprecedented pandemic. Many of you who contributed feedback for 21CP\u2019s review shared stories of positive experiences with our police officers and dispatchers, as well as appreciation for their presence on campus and their responsiveness in times of need and at a time of widespread concern about rising crime in our city.\n", "\nHowever, we do not shy away from the more difficult findings in this report, which reveal many of the same challenges associated with policing in municipalities and on campuses around the country: disproportionate stops and questioning of community members of color, particularly Black men; armed officers being dispatched to address non-criminal and/or non-violent situations, potentially escalating them; and a lack of good data with which to track and improve outcomes. We must be clear-eyed about the fact that too many members of our university community do not feel safe in the presence of DUPD officers. The report includes excerpts from some of the many stories shared throughout the review process from a diversity of voices \u2014 students, faculty, police and public safety personnel, other professional staff members, neighbors and community leaders. While they are distressing to read, we are very grateful to everyone who candidly shared their personal perspectives and sometimes painful experiences. Confronting the reality of our sharply divided perceptions and experiences of policing and public safety is critical to moving forward in forging a just and more inclusive path forward.\n", "\nIn light of the facts and feedback gathered during the review, the 21CP report makes two critical, overarching recommendations that Drexel will begin to implement:\n", "\nThis report represents the beginning of our collective journey toward reimagining public safety at Drexel and then doing the hard work involved in achieving what we reimagine. As with any department on campus, it is only fitting that we should take the time to reflect not only on what DUPD has done effectively since its inception, but also on the areas where we need to do better, respond to urgent social change and reflect fresh thinking about best practices. With your frank input, this report provides a roadmap for building a better, stronger, more holistic approach to campus public safety and health.\n", "\nWe agree wholeheartedly with 21CP on this point: \u201cThe Drexel community as a whole \u2014 rather than DUPD, Drexel administrators, or outside consultants \u2014 must be the ones to determine what public safety looks like, and how it is provided, at Drexel in the intermediate- and long-term.\u201d\n", "\nIn the weeks ahead, we will announce next steps in that collective reimagining process under Dr. Gold\u2019s proven leadership and distinctive insights about public health and safety. Marla has decades of experience working in and with diverse communities. She worked for equity and accessible care during the AIDS pandemic, worked with others to build our School of Public Health rooted in the connection of health and human rights, and more recently is leading us through the COVID pandemic. We will also immediately begin to work with Chief Behr and her leadership team at DUPD to address many of the specific operational recommendations also made by 21CP since they are committed to fulfilling the highest possible standard of service to everyone in the Drexel community, regardless of their race, ethnicity, culture or gender identity.  \n", "\nThis is hard and important work, and it is just getting started.
